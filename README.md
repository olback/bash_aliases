# bash_aliases install script / bash_aliases file
Bash aliases for ubuntu/debian/whatever runs ~/.bash_aliases at startup.

The idea here is that you download the ```install``` script and you run it. The script downloads the latest version of ```bash_aliases``` and puts it on your machine. If you want to update your ```bash_aliases``` file, just run the ```uba``` command.

#### Add your own aliases to this repo so that other people can use them
Open an issue or make a pull request and we'll get it sorted.

#### Where can i find a list of all the aliases?
It's simple, just read the ```bash_aliases``` file :p

#### Why not just copy/pasta the ```bash_aliases``` content?
What's the fun in that?
