# bash_aliases install script / bash_aliases file
Bash aliases for ubuntu/debian/whatever runs ~/.bash_aliases at startup.

If you'd like to add your own aliases, make a pull request.

The idea here is that you download the 'install' script and you run it. The script downloads the latest version of 'bash_aliases' and puts it on your machine. If you want to update your 'bash_aliases' file, just run the 'install' script again.

#### Why not just copy/pasta the 'bash_aliases' content?
What's the fun in that?
